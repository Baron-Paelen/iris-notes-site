Welcome to the IRIS Notes! This site was made in Obsidian using the [Digital Garden extension](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/), hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Baron-Paelen/iris-notes-site), and deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Many of the pages here heavily paraphrase or quote the [SAMD51 Datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/MCU32/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/SAM-D5x-E5x-Family-Data-Sheet-DS60001507.pdf).

The purpose of this website is to hopefully demystify the software side of IRIS by presenting a more digestible version of the SAMD51's datasheet. As of the creation of this website, we've started migrating to the [[20 - Professional/21 - SCIPP/21.01 - IRIS/IRIS-Notes-Site/docs/M4 Board\|M4 Board]], so most of the specifics will be tailored to the SAMD51/M4 board. 

Below you will find the currently available notes.
